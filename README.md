## ðŸ¤– My AI Usage

As part of this assignment, I made use of AI tools to assist in specific parts of the project.  
Below are the details:

- **AI Tools Used**: ChatGPT  
- **How I Used Them**:  
  - I used ChatGPT to generate initial **test cases** for my backend services.  
  - I also used ChatGPT to help **design the frontend layout** for the Sweet Management application, including structuring React components and styling ideas.  
- **Reflection on AI Impact**:  
  Using AI tools improved my workflow by saving time on repetitive tasks like writing boilerplate tests and providing quick inspiration for frontend design patterns.  
  However, I carefully reviewed, modified, and validated all AI-generated content to ensure it fit the project requirements and coding standards.  
  Overall, AI acted as a helpful assistant but the final implementation decisions and code were written, debugged, and validated by me.
